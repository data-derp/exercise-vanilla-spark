# Java Standard Edition

The Java version that I used for the examples demonstrated on the Spark Shell is Java 8 (specifically "adoptopenjdk8" openjdk ). This can be installed on your machines using the below commands :-

- brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
- brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8

Please also note that for the above command to work, you should have homebrew package manager installed on your machines. The link to do the same would be as follows :-

- https://brew.sh/
