# Java Standard Edition Set up Instructions

The Java version that I used for the examples demonstrated on the Spark Shell is Java 8 (specifically "adoptopenjdk8" openjdk ). This can be installed on your machines using the below commands :-

- brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
- brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8

Please also note that for the above command to work, you should have homebrew package manager installed on your machines. The link to do the same would be as follows :-

- https://brew.sh/

# Python Set up Instructions
The Python version I have used is the latest version  that comes with Anaconda (It's most simple and hassle-free, isn't it ?). So go to the anaconda link below and install the latest version most suitable for your machine processor :-

https://www.anaconda.com/

Once done, open a terminal, type "python" and hit Enter. It should start a python shell !

# Apache Spark Set up Instructions

The Apache Spark version that I used for the examples demonstrated use version 3.0.2. You can set it up on your local machine using the following steps :-

1. Please download the file named "spark-3.0.2-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz" (It should be ~ 200MB) from this [link](https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.0.2/) at a preferred location on your machine
2. Extract / Un tar it to get a folder by the name "spark-3.0.2-bin-hadoop2.7". (tar â€“xvzf spark-3.0.2-bin-hadoop2.7-hive1.2.tgz)
3. Set up the location of the folder extracted in step 2 as your SPARK_HOME your .bash_profile or .zshrc (export SPARK_HOME="<YOUR_PREFERRED_LOCATION>/spark-3.0.2-bin-hadoop2.7")
4. Add the bin folder of SPARK_HOME to the path (export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$SPARK_HOME/bin")
5. You should be good to go now. Echo SPARK_HOME (echo $SPARK_HOME) from your terminal and you should be able to get the path to your spark installation location.
6. Open a new terminal and type $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell. The spark shell should start with Spark version 3.0.2. 
7. You can do the same for pyspark ($SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark). Please note that in order for pyspark to work, you need to have python installed on your machines as mentioned above

# Repo set up in Pycharm
1. Please install PyCharm community edition from this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
2. Clone this repo on the location of your choice on your machine
3. Open the Repo in Pycharm. 
4. Let us start with configuring a Python Interpreter first.
5. Go to your Pycharm Settings, select your project and select the "Python Interpreter" option.
6. Make sure that you select "<No Interpreter>" from the dropdown and click "Add Interpreter" and select "Add Local Interpreter"
7. A dialog box will Pop up. Select the option of "Virtualenv Environment"
8. In the options on the RHS of the same dialog box, select Environment as "New", Location as any suitable location to save python "venv" folder on your local machine, leave the Base Interpreter as default and select "Inherit global site packages"
9. This should set up your Python Virtual Env for this repo. Double-check your Python interpreter from setting again and make sure that your newly created Python interpreter is selected for the project
10. Now if your Python Interpreter is created and selected as per the instructions above, you should get a message like "Package requirements 'pyspark...' etc. are not installed". Click on the "install requirement" link to install the plug-ins required for this repo. These plug-ins are listed down in the "requirements.txt" of this repo 
11. You are all set now to run your first program of this repo. Open File "00 - File Reads.py" from the SRC folder of this repo and run it. It should give you the desired output.

**PS**: Please note that you don't need a separate Apache Spark installation to run the example of this repo from Pycharm. The PySpark plug in you have configured above should be sufficient
